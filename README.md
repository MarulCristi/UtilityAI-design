# UtilityAI-design

This is a design of an application for our Software Engineering Course Project at LUT University. I want to point out I haven't coded it myself, however I'm happy I managed to make it reality despite my lack of knowledge in web programming. I have definitely learned something doing this project, especially the design.

The design is available at https://marulcristi.github.io/UtilityAI-design/
